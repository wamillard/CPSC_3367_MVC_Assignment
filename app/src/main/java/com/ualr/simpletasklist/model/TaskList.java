    // TODO 06.03. Define a new method called "add" that, given a task description, will create a
    //  new task and add it to the task list.

    // TODO 06.04. Define a new "toString" method that provides a formatted string with all the tasks in the task list.
    // Format: 1 line per task. Each line should start with the id number of the task, then a dash, and the task description right after that.
    // If the task is marked as done, "Done" should be included at the end of the line

    // TODO 07.03. Define a new method called "delete" that, given a task id, will delete the
    //  corresponding task from the task list.

    // TODO 08.03. Define a new method called "markDone" that, given a task id, will mark the
    //  corresponding task as done.
